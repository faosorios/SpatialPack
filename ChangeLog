0.3-81 (Jun 15, 2020)
	* Added routine to remove additive or multiplicative noise from a corrupted image.
	* Fixed error in function to compute the codispersion coefficient.
	* Code for imnoise was simplified.

0.3-8 (Jul 31, 2019)
	* Now underlying code for the computation of sample mean, variance and covariance
		is based on an online algorithm.
	* Added routine to convert RGB image to grayscale using several methods.
	* Added routines to add noise to image (available methods: gaussian, salt & pepper,
	  uniform and Gamma speckle).
	* Added routines to compute similarity between images.
	* Added some auxiliary routines.

0.3 (Mar 20, 2018)
	* Now routines modified.ttest and modified.Ftest return the estimated effective
		sample size and the unscaled F-statistic.
	* Added routine to compute the modified F-test (Dutilleul et al. 2008, JSPI 138,
		1402-1415).
	* Authors field at DESCRIPTION file was corrected.

0.2-3 (Aug 08, 2014)
	* Internal code for computation of codispersion coefficient and modified t-test
	  was corrected (contributed by Diego Mancilla).
	* Changes to NAMESPACE file to compliance with guidelines described in
		'Writing R Extensions' Section 1.5.

0.2 (Jun 15, 2012)
	* Initial release of the SpatialPack on CRAN.
