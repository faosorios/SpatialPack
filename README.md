# SpatialPack: Tools for assessment the association between two spatial

Tools to assess the association between two spatial processes. Currently, several methodologies are implemented: 
A modified t-test to perform hypothesis testing about the independence between the processes, a suitable nonparametric 
correlation coefficient, the codispersion coefficient, and an F test for assessing the multiple correlation between 
one spatial process and several others. Functions for image processing and computing the spatial association between 
images are also provided. SpatialPack gives methods to complement methodologies that are available in geoR for one 
spatial process.
